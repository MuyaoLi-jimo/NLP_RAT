# NLP_RAG

## Overview
This repository contains code and experimental setups for applying advanced prompting techniques to improve the performance of the deepseek-v2 model on the  MBPP datasets. The main focus is on comparing Chain of Thought prompting (CoT), In-context Learning (ICL), and Reflexion against na√Øve prompting techniques.
